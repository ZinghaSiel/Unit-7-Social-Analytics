**Twitter** has become a wildly sprawling jungle of informationâ€”140 characters at a time. Somewhere between 350 million and 500 million tweets are estimated to be sent out _per day_. With such an explosion of data, on Twitter and elsewhere, it becomes more important than ever to tame it in some way, to concisely capture the essence of the data.

This project consisted of analyzing tweet sentiments of some of the top Media/News outlets worldwide by pulling 100 of their latest tweets (from each account) using Tweepy API, storing them in a dataframe (later exported into a csv file) and presenting the findings visually (using a scatter plot and bar graph).

## Observable Trends

* The Overall Media Sentiments for CBS and BBC were (positive), with CBS topping BBC by 0.18 points.

* CNN and New York Times had neutral sentiments overall compared to Fox News that had a relative negative sentiment analysis.

* One limitation faced when analyzing these results was probably the fact that, the analysis performed here focused only on a 100 tweets and not necessarily a collection of tweets posted over a defined period of time.
